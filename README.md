# Sign Language Gesture Recognition

## Introduction

Effective communication is an essential aspect of human survival, enabling the conveyance of basic necessities such as clothing, shelter, food, and water. Beyond survival, communication serves as a means to socialize, express emotions, and provide mutual support. For individuals with speech and hearing impairments, sign language emerges as a vital mode of communication, relying on intricate hand gestures and expressions. 

The approach is vision-based, using cameras to capture images and videos of individuals using sign language. Sign languages vary among regions and countries, with Indian, Chinese, American, and Arabic being some of the major sign languages in use today. Deaf and hard-of-hearing people have unique needs when it comes to communication. That's why it's important to know sign language basics so you can communicate with them effectively. 

The main motive of this model is to create a solution that will self-train based on the sign language created by the disabled person.

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system that translates sign language into text. It leverages computer vision techniques using OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand detection, along with machine learning models for gesture classification.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes webcam input to detect and classify hand gestures in real time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays recognized gestures on the screen in a clear and concise manner.
- **Customizable Gesture Recognition**: Allows for the addition of new gestures specific to the userâ€™s needs.
